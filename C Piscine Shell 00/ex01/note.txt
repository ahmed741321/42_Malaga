In Unix/Linux operating systems, numeric values are used to represent permissions in the chmod command, where each character corresponds to one of the following permissions:
r (read): Read
w (write): Write
x (execute): Execute (for executable files only)

The conversion is as follows:
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1

To calculate the total permissions for a group, you add up the numbers corresponding to each character. For example:
rwx = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
rw- = 4 + 2 = 6
r-x = 4 + 1 = 5
r-- = 4
-wx = 2 + 1 = 3
--x = 1
--- = 0

we must use chmod ----- file name
