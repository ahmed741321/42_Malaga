find . -type f \( -name '*~' -o -name '#*#' \) -exec rm -f {} \; -print

Here's what this command does:

find .: Start the search from the current directory.
-type f: Only consider files, not directories.
\( -name '*~' -o -name '#*#' \): Match files ending with ~ or files starting and ending with #.
-exec rm -f {} \;: Execute rm -f command on each matched file to delete it. {} is a placeholder for the file name.
-print: Print the path of each file deleted.
Make sure to give execute permission to the clean file before running it. You can do so using the command:

chmod +x clean
